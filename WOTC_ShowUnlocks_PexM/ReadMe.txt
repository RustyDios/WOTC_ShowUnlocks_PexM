[h1]What is this?[/h1]
This is a plug-in for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2347354900] Show Tech Rewards [/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2222545926] Psionics Ex Machina 3.0 [/url]
It allows the Show Tech Rewards UI Panel in the Psionics Facility.

[h1]Why the additional mod?[/h1]
I just felt that the main Psionics Ex Machina mod was over-bloated with config/compatibility options. This works just as well as a plug-in mod, without polluting the main one with more bloat.

[h1]Any Changes?[/h1]
Not really, [strike]I use [b][ ][/b] instead of [b]{ }[/b] in my strings, I added options to adjust the UI font size[/strike] [b]TeslaRage[/b] incorporated these changes into the original mod

You can change the position and size of the box on the Psionics Ex Machina screen
Focuses solely on the Psionics Ex Machina screen ... 
Oh! .. and the list of unlocks for GEMs and Psi PCS' will obfuscate until you have owned at least one of the item, so it becomes this [i]'Gotta get them all'[/i] checklist :)

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Will have similar problems to the original Tech Rewards mod but it shouldn't matter much for the Psionics Ex Machina project screen as it is a more controlled environment of techs/unlocks.

Any mods that spawn a new UIPanel on the Psionics Ex Machina project screen will not be compatible. The UIPanel's will overlap each other unless the mods are adjusted so the new panels do not collide. It won't crash the game, but the screen will look messy.

This can also be used with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1581142050] Oni's Various Options[/url] as I only touch the PexM Facility screen.
Should be fine with anything Psionics Ex Machina is, LWotC, CI, RPGO etc.

Technically can work standalone to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2347354900] Show Tech Rewards [/url] but would be out of place.
It is much better to [b]have both[/b] for the full experience.

[h1]Known Issues[/h1]
May have some issues with controller users. 
The Unlocks panel may fail to update on scroll. Investigating a fix...

[h1]Credits and Thanks[/h1]
Obvious credit to both [b]TeslaRage[/b] and [b]Oni[/b] for the originals.
Many thanks to the XCOM2 Modders discord for constant support.

~ Enjoy [b]!![/b] and please [url=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/RustyDios] buy me a Cuppa Tea[/url]
